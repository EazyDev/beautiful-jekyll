He sat on the front seat  
As pleasant as if he is singing a melody  
In his white and orange car  
It passed round and round  
In the flowery November streets of Doha  
He is in his twenty forth   
For me, his name is Aslam,  
For reasons before centuries  
For my son he said ‘Acha’- very good  
For my two year old daughter he said Acha – very good  
At twenty eight they marry at Bangladesh  
His MamBap told to do so  
(His old Bap and weaving Mam)  
“*Shadi ke baad me nahee ayega*”  
After my marriage I won’t come  
(His fair angel bride and small cherubs on coming years  
On the banks of flood)  
No no no Aslam, don’t come shadi ke baad   
For my three and half riyals  
No money, you are my “*Sishter*”  
The cord of love  
From far east Bangladesh  
To the cost of Kerala  
I heard the sobs of my mother
