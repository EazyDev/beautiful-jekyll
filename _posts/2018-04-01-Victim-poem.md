Clouds hanging   
  
Through the rays  
  
Silhouetted the farfetched fears  
  
Of wounds  
  
Of threats  
  
Of a blue heart  
  
Stoned to eternalâ€¦..  
  
Ages to ages  
  
To stone the cocks  
  
To chew the heads of porcupine  
  
Against the face,  
  
Against the smile  
  
Against the fragrance of years
